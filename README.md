# Opening the Website
The first step is to open the website: [https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image].
# Choosing the Number of Classes
Upon opening the website, you need to choose the number of classes you want to train the model on. You can select multiple classes based on your needs.
# Uploading Images
Once you've selected the number of classes, you'll need to upload images related to each class. The images should be similar or share a common theme. For instance, if you're training the model to distinguish between different types of animals, one class should contain images of a specific type of animal.
# Training the Model
After uploading the images, you can start training the model. This is done by clicking the "Train Model" button. The machine will begin processing the data and training its own model.
# Uploading a Test Image
After the model training is complete, you can upload a new image to test how the model performs. The trained model will classify the new image based on the learned classes.
# Observing the Results Upon uploading the test image
the model will analyze and classify it according to the classes it was trained on. The results will be displayed on the screen, showing which class the image has been classified into.
